## Quick start

### Install

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
# You should also install BatteryML (https://github.com/microsoft/BatteryML)
```

### Preprocessing [[tutorial](./assets/Preprocess.md)]

After downloading all raw datasets provided in "Data availability" section, you can run the following script to obtain the processed datasets:

```
python preprocess_scripts.py
```

If you download the processed datasets, you can skip this step.

- During the development of BatteryLife, we frequently encountered problems where the processed data still contained potential issues after processing. Consequently, according to our experience, we have provided some Jupyter scripts for the double-check of processed data in the `./check_data_scripts/` folder to help the quick verification and processing of the data for the community. By conducting quick checks to ensure that all characteristic curves align with expectations, potential downstream complications can be effectively mitigated.

  - `check_capacity_curves.ipynb` : for checking charge and discharge capacities curve of the batteries..
  - `check_soh_curves.ipynb` : for checking the degradation trajectory of the batteries.
  - `check_voltage_current_curves.ipynb` : for checking the voltage and current curves of the batteries.

How to calculate the statistical information of aging conditions for processed data:

- Firstly, run the `aging_conditions.py` script to generate the `name2agingConditionID.json`, which the aging condition number for each battery.
- Secondly, run the `dataset_overview_calculation.py` script to calculate the aging conditions statistical information for preprocessed data.

### Train the model [[tutorial](./assets/Model_training.md)]

Before you start training, please move all **processed datasets (such as, HUST, MATR, et al.)** folders and **Life labels** folder (downloaded from Hugginface or Zenodo websites) into `./dataset` folder under the root folder.

After that, just feel free to run any benchmark method. For example:

```sh
sh ./train_eval_scripts/CPTransformer.sh
```

### Evaluate the model

If you want to evaluate a model in detail. We have provided the evaluation script. You can use it as follows:

```sh
sh ./train_eval_scripts/evaluate.sh
```

### Fine-tuning [[tutorial](./assets/Transfer_learning.md#Fine-tuning)]

If you want to fine-tune the pretrained model to another dataset. We have provided the fine-tuning script and the [tutorial](./assets/Transfer_learning.md#Fine-tuning). You can use it as follows:

```shell
sh ./train_eval_scripts/finetune_script.sh
```

### Domain adaptation [[tutorial](./assets/Transfer_learning.md#domain-adaptation)]

If you want to do the domain adaptation to another dataset. We have provided the domain adaptation script and the [tutorial](./assets/Transfer_learning.md#domain-adaptation). You can use it as follows:

```shell
sh ./train_eval_scripts/domain_adaptation_script.sh
```

## Welcome contributions

Advancing AI4Battery requires standardized datasets. However, the available battery life datasets are typically stored in different places and in different formats. We have put great efforts into integrating 13 previously available datasets and 3 of our datasets. BatteryLife aims to become a unified platform for sharing standardized battery aging and lifetime datasets. We warmly welcome contributions from the community—whether by sharing new datasets or standardizing existing ones according to the BatteryLife guidelines.

To further broaden the range of available resources, we list below several open-source but currently unprocessed datasets in the battery life domain:
